#  About Me

Hi, I’m Rex (Suyogya Joshi) — a cybersecurity student currently studying for my Bachelor of Cybersecurity in Australia.

I started this blog, RexSec, to document my journey as a beginner in the field and to share what I learn along the way. Here, you'll find walkthroughs from platforms like OverTheWire and TryHackMe, along with personal notes on various topics, tools, and experiments.

I hope you find these posts helpful and enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoy creating them!
