# 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Rex (Suyogya Joshi)** — a cybersecurity student and hands-on learner based in Australia.

I created **RexSec** to document my journey into ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defensive security. This blog is a digital lab notebook where I share:

-  Walkthroughs of platforms like **TryHackMe**, **OverTheWire**, and **Hack The Box**
-  My personal notes on **Linux**, **Bash scripting**, and **networking**
-  Insights into tools like **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, **Metasploit**, and more
-  Experiments with **Raspberry Pi**, **Python**, and offensive security

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- Land a cybersecurity internship in the next 6–10 months  
- Build a strong foundation in **offensive security**
- Master tools, techniques, and concepts through real labs  
- Earn certifications like **eJPT** and **CompTIA Security+**

---

## 🛠️ My Setup

-  **Laptop:** AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, RTX 3050  
-  **VMs:** Kali Linux, Windows, Ubuntu  
-  **Raspberry Pi 5:** Headless setup for remote practice
